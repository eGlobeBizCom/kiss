    <h1 class="center">KISS IDE 4.2 Tutorial: Project Overview</h1>
    <p>
      KISS IDE is an instructional integrated development environment for the C and C++ programming languages. In this tutorial, we'll
      be going over basic usage of the IDE to create a program with dependencies.

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Before we get started, it will be helpful to understand a few core concepts of KISS IDE and the C family of languages.</p>
    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>
      A <i>project</i> is a collection of source files, resources, and metadata that comprises a functional unit of code. For example,
      a project could be a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen. A project could also be a library that contains several
      helpful code snippets that other projects <i>depend</i> on.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Active Project</h3>
    <p>
      <img class="left sside pad" src="multi_proj.png" /></img>
      You may have multiple KISS projects open at a time. One of the open projects is the <i>active project</i>, indicated in the project sidebar by a heart icon. When you execute a target action or an action from the "Project" menu, it will be performed on the active project. The active project is chosen according to the file you are currently working on. To change the active project, open a file that is part of the desired project.
    </p>
    <p>
       Note that you can still perform operations on projects other than the active project by right-clicking on a project. For example, to compile a project that is not the active project, right-click on the project and click "Compile".
    </p>
    
    <h3>Dependencies</h3>
    Every project can <i>depend</i> on other projects to provide other pieces of functionality. For example, a professor (let's call him Dr. Muller) could distribute
    a project that provides implementations of concepts learned in class. Your project could then <i>depend</i> on Dr. Muller's project, which would allow you to
    use his code seamlessly with your own code.
    
    <h3>Targets</h3>
    <p>
      A <i>target</i> is a device or program that KISS IDE communicates with. A target could be a remote computer, your local machine,
      or even a robot controller. All targets support three primary operations: <i>download</i>, <i>compile</i>, and <i>run</i>.
      <ul>
        <li>Download - Sends the active project to the target.</li>
        <li>Compile - Sends the active project to the target and produces an executable program.</li>
        <li>Run - Runs the previously compiled program on the target.</li>
      </ul>
      These operations are <i>cascading</i>. For example, <i>run</i> will <i>download</i>, <i>compile</i>, <b>and</b> <i>run</i> a project. Target operations
      are also <i>recursively</i> executed on dependencies. For example, if project A depends on project B and project A is downloaded, project B will be downloaded as well.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Source File</h3>
    A <i>source file</i> is a file that contains <i>functions</i> and other definitions. For example, if we wanted to declare a function that returned the square of an integer, we could
    write of something like this:
    
    <pre>int square(int a) {
  return a * a;
}</pre>
    
    <h3>Header File</h3>
    <p>
      A header file isn't necessary until a project contains <b>multiple</b> source files. Let's say that we have a source file called <code>my_math.c</code> that contains utility
      functions like <code>square</code>. We now create another source file called <code>algebra.c</code> that will hold additional functions related to algebra. How do we use
      our utility function <code>square</code> inside <code>algebra.c</code>, even though it isn't declared inside that source file? The answer is a header file. A header file
      exposes <i>function prototypes</i> to all source files that <i>include</i> that header.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a header file for our <code>my_math.c</code> source file might be called <code>my_math.h</code> and look like this:
      <pre>int square(int a);</pre>
      Now all we need to do is add <pre>#include "my_math.h"</pre> to both <code>my_math.c</code> and <code>algebra.c</code> and we're ready to go!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Creating a New Project</h2>
    <p>
      Projects are the core abstraction of KISS IDE. To create a project, click the "New Project" icon in the center of the KISS IDE window.
      This will open the "New Project" dialog. This dialog requires two pieces of information:
      <img class="right side" src="../common/new_project.png"></img>
      <ul>
        <li>Project Name - The name of the project. This will also be the name of the project's folder.</li>
        <li>Save Location - The location to place the project folder. This can be changed by pressing "Browse".</li>
      </ul>
      Once you've decided the project name and save location, press "OK" to create the new project. You should now see the <i>project sidebar</i> on the
      right hand side of the KISS IDE window.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Creating a New Source File</h2>
    <p>
      <img class="left sside pad" src="right_click_proj.png"></img>
      We've created a project, but it doesn't do anything yet. To do something, we need to first add a <i>source file</i>. A source file contains executable
      code that the computer can <i>compile</i> and subsequently <i>run</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you create an empty project, a dialog will prompt you to add a new file to the project. Alternatively, you can right click on your project in the project sidebar,        then click "Add New File...". This will bring up the "Templates" dialog.
      The "Templates" dialog allows you to pick a starting point for your new file. For now, let's click <i>C Files > Hello, World!</i> and press "OK".
      <img class="right side" src="../common/templates.png"></img>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've pressed "OK", a new dialog called "New File Name" will appear. Let's name this file <code>hello</code> and press "OK". Notice that this
      created a file named <code>hello.c</code>. We didn't need to explicitly provide the file's extension. KISS IDE can automatically determine the file
      extension based on the selected template.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should now see <code>hello.c</code> under your project in the project sidebar. Note that you may need to expand the project by clicking on the
      project's "+" or arrow icon.
    </p>
    <h2>Compiling and Running</h2>
    <p>
      Now that we've created a project and a source file, we're ready to download, compile, and run our project as a program. To do that, click "Run" on KISS IDE's toolbar.
      If this is the first time you've clicked on a target operation, a "Target Selection" dialog will appear. Since we're wanting to run the program locally, click "My Computer"
      and press "OK". You should now see a progress indicator on KISS. Once the progress indicator disappears, your program should begin executing inside the "My Computer" application.
      Leave this "My Computer" application open for future target operations.
    </p>
    <h2>Depending on Projects</h2>
    <p>
      <img class="right side" src="dependencies.png"></img>
      Let's imagine that Dr. Muller has provided us with a KISS project that we need to <i>depend</i> on for an assignment. To add a dependency to our project, simply
      right click on the project and click "Project Settings". This will bring up the "Project Settings for ..." dialog where we can view and change various settings of the project.
      <p>Click on "Dependencies" in the left sidebar of this dialog to view the project's dependencies. To add a dependency, click "Add" and choose the project file (a .kissproj file) for the project you want to depend on. To remove a dependency, click on the dependency in the table and then click "Remove". Click "OK" when you are finished.
      </p>
